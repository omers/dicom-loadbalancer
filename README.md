# DICOM Load Balancer (WIP)

A scalable, high-performance DICOM load-balancer and router designed for medical imaging workflows. This solution provides zero-downtime operation for PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System) environments, supporting advanced routing rules, automated health-checks, and seamless integration into any medical-imaging infrastructure.

## Features

- **High-Performance Load Balancing**: Efficiently distribute DICOM traffic across multiple PACS nodes
- **Zero-Downtime Operation**: Ensure continuous service availability for critical medical imaging workflows
- **Advanced Routing Rules**: Route DICOM studies based on modality, body part, institution, and other DICOM tags
- **Automated Health Checks**: Continuously monitor destination nodes and automatically redirect traffic from failed nodes
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Deploy multiple instances for increased throughput and reliability
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Monitor performance, throughput, and system health with detailed metrics
- **DICOM Compliance**: Full compatibility with DICOM standards for seamless integration
